# Connect4
Dawson 2015 Data Communications and Networking Project. Java Client/Server Connect-Four game.  
Client uses JavaFX. Uses TCP for client/server connection. Threaded to allow multiple clients to play concurrently on a single server.

Made with 2 other classmates. The author is listed at the top of each java file. I wrote most of the server and connection logic. I also helped with the JavaFX UI.
